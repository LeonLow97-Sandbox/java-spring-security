# Spring Security with Basic Authentication

## Spring Security Internal Flow (Filters, Authentication Manager, Authentication Providers)

- Checks the path the user is trying to access on whether the user needs to be authenticated to access the resource.
  - Upon successful authentication, the next time spring security filter will know the user has been authenticated before based on the sessionID or token.
  - Stores the **authentication details** in the Security Context so Spring will not authenticate the user again after he has been authenticated.
- Extracts username and password and convert into an **authentication object** to store credentials of the user.
- Hands over the authentication request to the authentication manager.
- Authentication manager checks for the available authentication providers in the web application.
  - Write business logic in the authentication providers.
  - Can have multiple authentication provider and write authentication logic.
